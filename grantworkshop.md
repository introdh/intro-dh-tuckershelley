# Grant Workshop


## Question/ Abstract

Here in your repository, write your answers to the following: 

### (1) Formulate the humanities question(s) guiding the project. 

What makes a perfect rap song? What are popular topics of lyrics in hit rap songs? How do hit rap songs represent the culture they were originated in? 

### (2) Provide a one-paragraph abstract written for a nonspecialist audience, clearly explaining the project’s principal activities and its expected results.

The characterstics of a strong abstract:

- explains the humanities question(s) guiding the project
- includes the DH methods that will be used and why
- identifies which humanities fields/ disciplines the project is engaged in 

Rap, R&B, and Hip Hop aren't typically viewed through a scholarly lens. However, now that it is the most popular genre in the country, I think it's about time that changed. It is clear that rap music has a large influence over the greater American culture and vise versa. The goal of this grant is to tease apart common themes in popular rap songs. We will be looking at common topics in popular rap songs and comparing and contrasting them with each other. The plan is to get a corpus from the top 40 list of rap songs the last decade or so and run them through mallet to create a visualization of frequent topics. This falls in the field of music and US literature. Going one step deeper than just creating the visualization, a main focus of this project will be to use these topics to make assumptions about the culture surrounding rap. Being the most popular genre in the country, it speaks real hidden truths about us, the listeners and buyers.
