* Writeup
For this project I made a network of connections between supreme court cases. Each node is a specific court case and the edges represent references to a different case. I chose cases from three different topics of court cases to see if they were often cited by the other cases. The three topics I chose were involuntary confession, desegregation, and due process: prisoners rights and defendents rights. I figured that there would be a lot of connections between involuntary confession and prisoners and defendents rights as their rights would be violated in the process of a forced confession. I also wanted to look at race and see if there were many connections between desegregation issues and these two topics. Below is an image of the issues each color coded in the network that I created.
