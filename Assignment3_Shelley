For my project I decided to take a closer look at Denver, CO. I chose this city because I lived in Boulder for a year and would frequently make trips into the city of Denver. I also thought it would be interesting to take a look at a city that isn't on the coast, as the birth of the city doesn't involve ports and seaways. What was done during this project was a georectification of an old map over a map of the current state of that same area. The old map is a visual representation of an initiative done during the great depression that allotted grades to different neighborhoods and areas determining the amount of risk associated with investing in real estate in that area. Blocks that earned the grade of "A"p was georectified over a map of united states census blocks from 2010. Each block contains data about the racial makeup up of said block.
