For my project I decided to take a closer look at Denver, CO. I chose this city because I lived in Boulder for a year and would frequently make trips into the city of Denver. I also thought it would be interesting to take a look at a city that isn't on the coast, as the birth of the city doesn't involve ports and seaways. What was done during this project was a georectification of an old map over a map of the current state of that same area. The old map is a visual representation of an initiative done during the great depression that allotted grades to different neighborhoods and areas determining the amount of risk associated with investing in real estate in that area. Blocks that earned the grade of "A" were racially and ethnically homogeneous and would allow for the most growth, while blocks with a "D" grade were considered hazardous and had a more diverse racial makeup (Hillier, ESRI, 2002). This map was georectified over a map of united states census blocks from 2010. Each block contains data about the racial makeup up of said block. I chose to look at the percentage of how white each block is. The darker red the block, the higher the percent of white people residing there. Below is a zoomed out picture of the two maps rectified upon one another.

This initiative, from 1933-1936, done by the FDR administration, is a blatant case of systemic, political racism. These blocks with large amounts of minorities were automatically considred less succeptible to growth. Whether or not it was true that they were less succeptible to growth, this labeling of "hazardous" would deter real estate moguls from investing in that block. Thus, a cycle of systemic oppression began in these minority heavy areas.
